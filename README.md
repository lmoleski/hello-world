My first repository ever

I am just tickled pink to FINALLY start data analysis and coding. There is much to learn for this young padawan, but holy smokes am I excited to start using my brain. I have truly loved my job as an ESL teacher, but when you stop learning as a teacher, you stop being an excited, exciting teacher, which is no good for you and terrible for your students. Thus it is time for a change! Let's get coding!
